## Learnings
- Signals - values that change over time (State).
- Derived signals - values that changes when signals change (Computed state).
- Effects - effects are observers that listening to changes in signals.
- Components only render once - each JSX that has a signal act as an effect which tracks signal changes to update the dom.
- Destructure props are un-reactive while Undestructured props are reactive in solid.
- Always make computed signals functions if you want them to be reactive.
- memo (Donâ€™t understand yet).
